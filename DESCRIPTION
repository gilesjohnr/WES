Description: Provides reproducible functions for collating and analyzing 
     data from wastewater and environmental sampling studies. Wastewater and 
     Environmental Sampling (WES) of infectious diseases involves collecting 
     samples from various sources (such as sewage, water, air, soil, or surfaces) 
     to monitor the presence of pathogens in the environment. Analysis of WES 
     data often requires the calculation of Real-Time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) 
     variables, normalizing WES observations, and analyzing sampling site 
     characteristics. To help reduce the complexity of these analyses we have 
     implemented tools that assist with establishing standardized WES data 
     formats, absolute and relative quantification of qPCR data, estimation 
     of qPCR amplification efficiency, and collating open-source spatial data 
     for sampling sites.
