Description: Provides reproducible functions for collating and analyzing 
     data from environmental sampling studies. Environmental Sampling (ES) 
     of infectious diseases involves collecting samples from various sources 
     (such as sewage, water, air, soil, or surfaces) to monitor the presence 
     of pathogens in the environment. Analysis of ES data often requires the 
     calculation of Real-Time Quantitative PCR (qPCR) variables, normalizing 
     ES observations, and analyzing sampling site characteristics. To help 
     reduce the complexity of these analyses we have implemented tools that 
     assist with establishing standardized ES data formats, absolute and 
     relative quantification of qPCR data, estimation of qPCR amplification 
     efficiency, and collating open-source spatial data for sampling sites.
